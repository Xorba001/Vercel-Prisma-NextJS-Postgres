Passwordless Authentication with Next.js, Prisma, and NextAuth
In this post, we'll learn how to add passwordless authentication to your Next.js app using Prisma and next-auth. User will be able to log in to your app with either their GitHub account or a Slack-style magic link sent right to their Email inbox.

Prisma is a type-safe database client that replaces traditional ORMs, and makes database access easy with an auto-generated query builder. Coupled with next-auth, we only need a few steps to implement the complete authentication mechanism, and don't need to write any SQL code ourselves.
